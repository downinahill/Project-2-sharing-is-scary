        <h3>I'm an artist based in the DC area. Otherwise known as the DMV or Nova since I live in Northern Virginia. And it's the aftermath<br>
            of said space anomaly. It's a black hole that I've seen destroy the lives of too many people. And I'll be leaving here pretty soon.<br>
            This is one of the most affluent areas in the country, but somehow I missed out on all of that. I took a different path<br>
            and paid the price. Most of these pieces of art reflect that price and paint the picture of my misguided decisions combined with unfortunate luck.<br>
            I do, however, appreciate all art and don't really like to stick to one genre. Some are nice and friendly and some are dark yet honest.<br>
            Some are landscapes. Some are portraits. Some are imaginative constructs of my personal experiences, combining genres and techniques to form<br>
            something entirely new. I prefer the latter. I prefer expression and creativity rather than just drawing what I see with my physical eyes.<br>
            Welcome to my mind.
