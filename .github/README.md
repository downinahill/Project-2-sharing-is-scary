In this project I used HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Node.js, Express.js, Mongoose, and MongoDB. I created an art sharing app that utilizes the API Multer to allow users to upload files to the app. I had a lot of trouble doing this, but finally got some help and was able to figure it out by storing the data in a seperate folder called uploads and changing the names of the files. I would like to come back to this at some point and add a comment section as well as maybe a forum and a messaging section. https://bestartshare.herokuapp.com/
